## Hazard Identification

**Chemical Exposure:** Workers can be exposed to volatile organic compounds and other hazardous chemicals found in petroleum products and thermal coating substances[^23] [^24]. 
Prolonged exposure can lead to respiratory issues, skin irritation, and more severe conditions like chemical pneumonitis[^23] [^24] [^25].

**Particulate Matter:** The process of extracting and processing cellulose from wood pulp generates dust and fine particulate matter[^26] [^27]. 
Inhalation of these particles can lead to respiratory conditions, including chronic bronchitis and lung function impairment[^26] [^27].

## Evaluation

### Level of Risk to Workers

The risk level of workers extracting petroleum-based agents and wood pulp is especially high[^24] [^27]. 
For example, workers are at increased risk for cancer, including mesothelioma, prostate cancer, and lung cancer[^23] [^24] [^25].
Exposure to hazardous chemicals can lead to respiratory diseases, skin disorders, and other long-term health complications[^25].

### Measurement of Risk

- **Hazard Identification:** Analyzing work processes and potential sources of chemical or physical harm[^21].

- **Environmental Monitoring:** Sampling air, water, and surfaces for specific chemicals or contaminants[^24].

- **Biomonitoring:** Measuring levels of substances or their metabolites in workers’ bodily fluids (blood, urine)[^24].

### Exposure Limits

One of the key challenges in setting occupational exposure limits (OELs) for petroleum industry workers is the complex mixture of hydrocarbons and other potentially hazardous agents they can be exposed to[^28]. 
For example, hydrogen sulfide and acetone serve as a key precursor in the production of chemicals found in receipt paper, such as BPA and BPS[^28].

#### Hydrogen Sulfide OELs

| Country | Agency | TWA† Exposure Limit | Workplace Exposure Limit |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| United States | Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)[^29] | 20 ppm | 20 ppm |
| Canada | Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS)[^30] | 1 ppm | - |
| European Union | European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)[^31] | 1 ppm‡ | - |

>†_Note. Time-weighted average (TWA) is the average exposure over eight hours._<br>
>‡_Note. The EU does not specify a unified limit, but 1 ppm is widely referenced._

#### Acetone OELs

| Country | Agency | TWA† Exposure Limit | Workplace Exposure Limit |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| United States | Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)[^32] | 1000 ppm‡ | 3000 ppm |
| Canada | Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS)[^33] | 250 ppm | 500 ppm |
| European Union | European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)[^34] | - | 500 ppm |

>†_Note. Time-weighted average (TWA) is the average exposure over eight hours._<br>
>‡_Note. The California Division of OSHA exposure limit is 500 ppm TWA._

#### Wood Dust OELs

For wood pulp production and extraction, the following OELs for wood dust are published. Note that different wood species carry unique risks and exposure concerns[^35].

| Country | Agency | TWA† Exposure Limit | Workplace Exposure Limit |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| United States | Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)[^35] | 5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> | 15 mg/m<sup>3</sup> |
| Canada | Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS)[^36] | 1–5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> | – |
| European Union | European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)[^37] | 2 mg/m<sup>3</sup> | – |

>†_Note. Time-weighted average (TWA) is the average exposure over eight hours._<br>

### Types of Workers Most at Risk

- **Drilling & Fracking Crews:** Especially workers with direct exposure to crude oil, hydrogen sulfide, acetone, and fracking chemicals[^24].

- **Mechanics & Maintenance Workers:** Workers can be exposed to a wide range of chemicals and physical hazards[^24].

- **Pulp Mill Workers:** Workers with direct exposure to chemicals used in pulping and bleaching processes[^27].

- **Transportation Workers:** Accidents involving tankers, exposure to hazardous materials, chemical off-gassing during transport of wood pulp, and during loading and unloading[^24] [^27].

### Potential Burden of Injury/Illness

- **Acute injuries:** Burns, lacerations, crush injuries, respiratory harm from chemical releases or exposure[^24] [^27].

- **Chronic illnesses:** Cancers (leukaemia, lung cancer)[^38], respiratory diseases (silicosis, COPD, bronchitis)[^25], skin conditions (dermatitis, chemical burns)[^23] [^25], neurological disorders[^24], asthma and allergic reactions (wood dust, mould)[^26].

## Control

**Elimination and Substitution:** Replacing hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives[^24].

**Engineering Controls:** Ventilation systems to reduce airborne contaminants, soundproofing to mitigate exposure[^24] [^27].

**Administrative Controls:** Implementing shift rotations to limit exposure time, proper training on the hazards and safe handling of chemicals[&24] [^28].

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Gloves, masks, and protective clothing to minimize direct exposure[^28].
