### Topcoat

The **topcoat** on receipt paper, also known as the protective layer, is applied over the thermal coating to protect the thermally sensitive layer from environmental factors, abrasion, and other physical damages that could affect the print quality and longevity[^7] [^9].

### Thermal Layer

At its core, the **thermal layer** contains a mix of active agents that undergo a colour-changing process when exposed to heat[^7] [^9] [^10] [^11] [^12]. The next section explores the layer in greater detail.

### Precoat

The **precoat** is the coating between the base paper and the thermal-sensitive layer, smoothing the base paper's surface for a uniform and precise interaction with the thermal printhead[^7] [^9].

### Base Paper

The **base paper** constitutes the actual paper part of the receipt, offering the essential stability, durability, and specific physical qualities needed for thermal printing[^7] [^9].

### Backcoat

The **backcoat** functions as a protective layer, increasing durability and offering protection from physical and environmental damage[^7] [^9].

Next, we'll delve into the mechanism responsible for the colour change in receipt paper.
