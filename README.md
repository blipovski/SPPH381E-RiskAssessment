# SPPH 381E Project Website

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Project Website repository ðŸ‘‹

This website is the result of my examination into the health and occupational hazards associated with receipt paper. This project was submitted as part of the risk assessment assignment for the SPPH 381E (Work & Health) course at the University of British Columbia during the spring semester of 2024. Designed using Hugo, a static site generator written in Go, this website uses the Hextra theme to host an engaging and accessible space to share my findings and insights.

The SPPH project website, hosted at https://spph.lipovski.ca, is structured to guide visitors through the intricate details of receipt paper's impact, from production to disposal. The website is divided into main sections: Introduction, Background, Life Cycle Assessment, and Risk Assessment, providing a clear and linear progression of information.

# Features

- **Documentation-Style Layout:** Information is organized in a logical sequence, making it easy to navigate and understand the complex subject matter.
- **Interactive Elements:** Utilize previous and next buttons for smooth navigation between sections, and access various topics through the sidebar or homepage buttons.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** The website consolidates a wealth of research findings, presenting them in a user-friendly digital format.
