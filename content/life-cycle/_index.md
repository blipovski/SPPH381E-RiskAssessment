The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) critically examines the environmental footprint of thermal receipt paper from production to disposal. This analysis uses the framework of ISO standards 14040 and 14044 to ensure a systematic and scientifically rigorous evaluation. These standards guide the LCA process, from defining the scope to interpreting the results, and are pivotal for understanding the ecological impacts of thermal paper at each life cycle stage. The following subsection introduces these ISO standards in detail, setting the stage for a comprehensive environmental review that aims to identify sustainable improvements within the industry.

### Goal & Scope Definition

This initial step involves clarifying the purpose of the assessment, the product system to be studied (thermal receipt paper), and the boundaries of the analysis, including what stages of the paper's life cycle will be assessed, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal.

### Inventory Analysis

This phase involves collecting data on all inputs and outputs associated with the life cycle of thermal receipt paper. Inputs can include raw materials (like paper and chemicals for the thermal coating), energy, and water, while outputs might include emissions to air, water, and soil, as well as waste generated.
