These layers, comprising the topcoat, thermal layer, base paper, precoat, and backcoat, work in concert to ensure the print‚Äôs durability and clarity. Central to its function is the thermal layer, where a mix of active agents triggers the color-changing process essential for printing.\nTopcoat The topcoat on receipt paper, also known as the protective layer, is applied over the thermal coating to protect the thermally sensitive layer from environmental factors, abrasion, and other physical damages that could affect the print quality and longevity. This top coat is crucial for ensuring the durability and reliability of the printed information.\nThermal Layer Central to its function is the thermal layer, where a mix of active agents triggers the color-changing process essential for printing.\nPrecoat The precoat in receipt paper, sometimes referred to as the primer layer, is a foundational coating applied between the base paper and the thermal-sensitive layer. Its main purpose is to smooth out the surface of the base paper, providing an optimal substrate for the uniform application of the thermal-sensitive coating. The pre-coat enhances the quality and sensitivity of the final thermal print by ensuring that the thermal layer is evenly distributed, which is crucial for consistent image quality.\nBase Paper The base paper in receipt paper serves as the foundation upon which the thermal coating is applied. It is typically made from high-quality, fine paper that is designed to provide stability, durability, and the proper physical characteristics needed for thermal printing. The base paper must be smooth and uniform to ensure consistent heat transfer during the printing process, resulting in clear and precise images or text.\nBackcoat The backcoat on receipt paper serves as a protective layer applied to the reverse side of the paper, opposite the thermally sensitive side. Its primary purpose is to protect the paper from physical and environmental damage, enhance durability during handling and printing, and sometimes to facilitate smooth feeding through printers and scanning devices. The backcoat is especially important for rolls of thermal paper used in high-speed printers, where friction and static electricity can cause wear and tear."},"title":"Background"},"/background/chemicals/":{"data":{"":"","thermal-layer#Thermal Layer":" flowchart LR leuco([Leuco Dye]) ---\u003e pcm[Phase Change Material] dev([Developer]) ---\u003e pcm pcm --\u003e tl[Thermal Layer] sen([Sensitizers]) --\u003e tl stab([Stabilizers]) --\u003e tl tl --\u003e rp((( Receipt Paper))) style tl stroke-width:4px,stroke-dasharray: 0Within the thermal layer, six chemical components facilitate a reaction when the receipt paper is exposed to heat. Critically, the agents responsible for the color change are the leuco dye, developer, and phase change materials. Although the precise composition may vary, these chemicals are commonly used:\nLeuco Dyes Leuco Dyes are colourless (or nearly colourless) compounds that can be transformed into a coloured state by a chemical reaction. In thermal paper, leuco dyes develop colour when they react with developers. The colour change typically occurs due to a structural change in the dye molecule, which alters the way it absorbs and reflects light.\nFluoran Crystal Violet Lactone Developers Developers are chemicals that react with leuco dyes in the presence of heat to produce the colour change. Developers have acidic properties that trigger leuco dyes to change colour.\nPhase Change Materials (PCM) Phase change materials serve as the medium within which the leuco dye and developer are embedded. When heat is applied, it melts, allowing a reaction between the leuco dye and developer.hugo\n‚ÑπÔ∏è Although the precise composition may vary, these are some of the most commonly used chemicals: "},"title":"Chemicals"},"/background/context/":{"data":{"":"","comparison#Comparison":"RP is a chemically coated paper that reacts to heat for inkless printing. Designed to be cost-effective for businesses requiring swift, ink-free printing, RP is available in rolls, making it easily adaptable to the high-volume demands of retail and service industry transactions. However, its chemical coating poses environmental recycling challenges, contrasting with the more straightforward, eco-friendly recycling of regular paper. Additionally, RP has limitations for preserving documents long-term because the information gradually fades with time. Nevertheless, its adoption continues unabated and remains the global standard for businesses globally.","what-is-receipt-paper#What is Receipt Paper?":"A point-of-sales (POS) receipt is a document acknowledging that a person has received money or property in payment following a sale or other transfer of goods or provision of a service. It serves as proof of transaction and typically includes details such as the date of purchase, the items purchased, their prices, the total amount paid, and the seller‚Äôs information. Unlike other receipts, such as invoices which are issued prior to payment as a request for payment, or e-receipts sent digitally to customers, POS receipts are tangible proof provided immediately after a purchase.\n‚ÑπÔ∏è This project uses the term Receipt Paper is used "},"title":"Context"},"/intro/":{"data":{"":" Image Courtesy of Towfiqu Barbhuiya on Unsplash ","the-paper-trail-begins#The Paper Trail Begins":"In the vast landscape of consumerism, paper receipts hold a crucial place in the routine functioning of business transactions. Utilized across various sectors, such as grocery stores, banking, restaurants, and gas stations, receipts have become an omnipresent component of modern commerce. Receipts, valued for their fast and legible printing, play a crucial role in personal and commercial accounting. Although Canada does not have explicit legislation mandating receipts (for payment acknowledgement), it has become a widely adopted practice, effectively making it a de facto standard.\nWith receipts being produced for every transaction, we have become inundated with a constant stream of paper, contributing to environmental concerns and clutter in our daily lives. Given that Canada processes around 30 million financial transactions daily (Bank of Canada), it is difficult to quantify the number of receipts produced. Highlighting the broader context, the global market for receipt paper was estimated at USD 4.16 billion in 2023 (Grandview Research), demonstrating the vast consumption and environmental footprint of transactions worldwide. Transitioning from the scale of consumption to its environmental implications, the life cycle of receipt paper offers insight into the multifaceted impacts and risks of this ubiquitous product.\nThe purpose of this project is to examine the lifecycle of receipt paper, from resource extraction through to disposal. Concurrently, this project aims to perform an in-depth risk assessment of occupational hazards throughout each phase and analyze the effectiveness of current hazard control measures. The objective of this analysis is to illuminate the environmental and health implications of receipt paper production and use, guiding more sustainable practices and risk mitigation strategies.\nThis project is based on a modified approach to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards."},"title":"Introduction"},"/life-cycle/":{"data":{"":"","#":" Image Courtesy of Panda Paper on Unsplash The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) critically examines the environmental footprint of thermal receipt paper from production to disposal.
