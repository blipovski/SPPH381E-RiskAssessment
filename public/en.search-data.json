The most critical of these are the leuco dye, developer, and phase change materials2 3 4 5.\n‚ÑπÔ∏è The chemicals listed are among the most commonly used in the industry. Note that the precise composition may vary between products and manufacturers. Leuco Dyes Leuco Dyes are colourless (or nearly colourless) compounds that can be transformed into a coloured state by a chemical reaction2 3. In thermal paper, leuco dyes develop colour when they react with developers2 3. The colour change typically occurs due to a structural change in the dye molecule, which alters the way it absorbs and reflects light2 3.\nTwo most common leuco dyes used (click to learn more)6 7:\nFluoranFluoran is a broad category of leuco dyes that can produce typically black or blue. Crystal Violet Lactone (CVL)CVL is a triphenylmethane leuco dye that is used to produce blue or violet. Developers Developers trigger the colour change process by chemically reacting with the leuco dye1 8 2. Upon the application of heat, the medium (see below) encapsulating the developers melts, releasing them to chemically react with the leuco dye1 8 2.\nTwo most common developers used (click to learn more)9 10:\nBisphenol A (BPA)BPA is a common and easily produced industrial chemical with acidic properties. Bisphenol S (BPS)BPS is a chemical alternative to BPA with similar acidic properties. Phase Change Materials (PCM) Phase change materials serve as the medium within which the leuco dye and developer are embedded1 2. When heat is applied, it melts, allowing a reaction between the leuco dye and developer. A commonly used PCM is paraffin wax1 2.\nNext, we will explore the colour-changing reaction that occurs between these critical chemicals.\nOuyang F.

Heat is applied directly to the thermal receipt paper as it passes under the printhead1 2. This localized heating is the trigger for the subsequent chemical reactions in the coated layer of the paper, initiating the color development process in specific areas to create the desired print1 2 3.\nImage Courtesy of Fourohfour from Wikimedia PCM Melting The PCM melts when exposed to the heat from the printhead1 2. As the leuco dye and developer are suspended in the PCM, they are not able to interact1 2.\nThermochromic Reaction The developer, which is commonly BPA or BPS4 5, has acidic properties that trigger a phase change in the leuco dye1 2. This event, called protonation, involves the developer donating hydrogen ions (protons) to the leuco dye6 7. Adding a hydrogen ion changes the leuco dye‚Äôs structure, altering how the molecule interacts with light and thus its color6 7. This process is called a thermochromic reaction as it involves a change in colour triggered by temperature changes2 3 6 7. The exact color produced depends on the structure of the leuco dye and the nature of the protonation6 7.\nBelow is an example of the chemical reaction between the leuco dye fluoran and BPA.\nImage Courtesy of Gogoi \u0026 Neog, 2016 Cooling After moving beyond the printhead, the PCM starts to cool down and solidify1 2. During this time, the developer and leuco dye are resuspended, albeit in an altered configuration2 3. Unless heat is reapplied, printed receipt paper will maintain its chemical integrity1 2. Over time, the chemical bonds in the paper start to break down, leading to a gradual fading of the print as its stability decreases1 2.\nOuyang F.

Utilized across various sectors, such as grocery stores, banking, restaurants, and gas stations, receipts have become an omnipresent component of modern commerce. Receipts, valued for their fast and legible printing, play a crucial role in personal and commercial accounting. Although Canada does not have explicit legislation mandating receipts1 2, it has become a widely adopted practice, effectively making it a de facto standard.\nWith receipts being produced for every transaction, we have become inundated with a constant stream of paper, contributing to environmental concerns and clutter in our daily lives. Given that Canada processes around 30 million financial transactions daily3, it is difficult to quantify the number of receipts produced. Highlighting the broader context, the global market for receipt paper was estimated at USD 4.16 billion in 20234, demonstrating the vast consumption and environmental footprint of transactions worldwide. Transitioning from the scale of consumption to its environmental implications, the life cycle of receipt paper offers insight into the multifaceted impacts and risks of this ubiquitous product.\nThe purpose of this project is to examine the lifecycle of receipt paper, from resource extraction through to disposal. Concurrently, this project aims to perform an in-depth risk assessment of occupational hazards throughout each phase and analyze the effectiveness of current hazard control measures. The objective of this analysis is to illuminate the environmental and health implications of receipt paper production and use, guiding more sustainable practices and risk mitigation strategies.\nCanada Revenue Agency.
