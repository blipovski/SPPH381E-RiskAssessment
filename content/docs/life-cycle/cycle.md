This life cycle assessment critically examines the environmental footprint of thermal receipt paper from production to disposal[^19] [^20]. 
This analysis partially uses the framework of ISO standards 14040 and 14044 to ensure a systematic and scientifically rigorous evaluation[^19] [^20].

## Resource Extraction

Receipt paper is primarily made up of petroleum-based products[^11] [^12] and wood pulp[^9]. 
These materials are selected for their ability to interact effectively under thermal stress to ensure the durability and clarity of the print[^9] [^11] [^12]
Therefore, this stage involves the extraction of essential raw materials, including cellulose from wood pulp[^9] and specialized chemicals for the thermal coating[^10] [^11] [^12].

## Manufacturing

The manufacturing process of thermal receipt paper comprises multiple phases: the conversion of wood into pulp, paper production, and the addition of the thermal coating[^9] [^10]. 
During the primary phases of production, the chemicals are synthesized from petroleum-based precursors[^9] [^10]. 
In the secondary phases, these chemicals are blended to produce the individual layers[^9] [^10]. 
Finally, these layers are assembled to complete the receipt paper, which is then wound into rolls for distribution[^7] [^9].

## Distribution

This involves the transportation of the finished thermal receipt paper to various distribution centres and retail outlets[^18] [^21]. 
The environmental impact of transportation primarily comprises emissions released by transport vehicles and the related consumption of energy[^21].

## Use

The usage phase involves issuing printed receipts to customers. 
While the direct environmental impact of this phase is minor[^21], research has suggested that handling receipt paper exposes both workers and consumers to hazardous concentrations of BPA and BPS[^8] [^17] [^18] [^22].

## Disposal

The end-of-life for thermal receipt paper typically results in it being sent to landfills or undergoing incineration[^8] [^21]. 
This disposal process has environmental consequences, including the release of chemicals, especially BPA and BPS[^8], into soil and groundwater at landfill sites, and emissions generated through incineration[^21].
