Before we delve into the details of receipt paper, it’s crucial to understand how this website is organized. 
The site is designed with a documentation-style approach, organizing information in a clear and linear progression. 
The project is divided into four main sections: (1) introduction, (2) background, (3) life cycle assessment, and (4) risk assessment.
