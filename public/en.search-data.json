Critically, the agents responsible for the color change are the leuco dye, developer, and phase change materials.\n‚ÑπÔ∏è The examples listed are among the most frequently utilized chemicals. The precise composition may vary between products and manufactorers. Leuco Dyes Leuco Dyes are colourless (or nearly colourless) compounds that can be transformed into a coloured state by a chemical reaction. In thermal paper, leuco dyes develop colour when they react with developers. The colour change typically occurs due to a structural change in the dye molecule, which alters the way it absorbs and reflects light.\nTwo most common leuco dyes used (click to learn more):\nFluoranFluoran is a broad category of leuco dyes that can produce typically black or blue. Crystal Violet Lactone (CVL)CVL is a triphenylmethane leuco dye that is used to produce blue or violet. Developers Developers are chemicals that react with leuco dyes in the presence of heat to produce the colour change. Developers have acidic properties that trigger leuco dyes to change colour.\nTwo most common developers used (click to learn more):\nBisphenol A (BPA)subtitle Bisphenol S (BPS)Subtitle Phase Change Materials (PCM) Phase change materials serve as the medium within which the leuco dye and developer are embedded. When heat is applied, it melts, allowing a reaction between the leuco dye and developer."},"title":"Chemicals"},"/background/layers/":{"data":{"":"","#":" Image Courtesy of Panda Paper on Unsplash Thermal receipt paper utilizes a thermochromic process for inkless printing, achieved through its multi-layered composition. These layers, comprising the topcoat, thermal layer, base paper, precoat, and backcoat, work in concert to ensure the print‚Äôs durability and clarity. Central to its function is the thermal layer, where a mix of active agents triggers the color-changing process essential for printing.\nTopcoat The topcoat on receipt paper, also known as the protective layer, is applied over the thermal coating to protect the thermally sensitive layer from environmental factors, abrasion, and other physical damages that could affect the print quality and longevity.\nThermal Layer At its core, the thermal layer contains a mix of active agents that undergo a colour-changing process when exposed to heat. The next section explores the layer in greater detail.\nPrecoat The precoat is the coating between the base paper and the thermal-sensitive layer, smoothing the base paper‚Äôs surface for a uniform and precise interaction with the thermal printhead.\nBase Paper The base paper constitutes the actual paper component of receipts, offering the essential stability, durability, and specific physical qualities needed for thermal printing.\nBackcoat The backcoat functions as a protective layer, increasing durability and offering protection from physical and environmental damage.\nThe image below offers a visual representation of the layers and their respective proportions.\nImage Courtesy of Jujo Thermal Next, let‚Äôs take a deeper look at the mechanism of action that causes the receipt paper to change colour."},"title":"Structural Anatomy"},"/background/reaction/":{"data":{"":"","thermal-layer#Thermal Layer":"Thermal Layer "},"title":"Reaction"},"/intro/":{"data":{"":" Before we delve into the details of receipt paper, it‚Äôs crucial to understand how this website is organized.

Designed to be cost-effective for businesses requiring swift, ink-free printing, RP is available in rolls, making it easily adaptable to the high-volume demands of retail and service industry transactions. However, its chemical coating poses environmental recycling challenges, contrasting with the more straightforward, eco-friendly recycling of regular paper. Additionally, RP has limitations for preserving documents long-term because the information gradually fades with time. Nevertheless, its adoption continues unabated and remains the global standard for businesses globally.","what-is-receipt-paper#What is Receipt Paper?":"A point-of-sales (POS) receipt is a document acknowledging that a person has received money or property in payment following a sale or other transfer of goods or provision of a service. It serves as proof of transaction and typically includes details such as the date of purchase, the items purchased, their prices, the total amount paid, and the seller‚Äôs information. Unlike other receipts, such as invoices which are issued prior to payment as a request for payment, or e-receipts sent digitally to customers, POS receipts are tangible proof provided immediately after a purchase.\n‚ÑπÔ∏è This project uses the term Receipt Paper is used "},"title":"Key Definitions"},"/intro/start/":{"data":{"":" Image Courtesy of Towfiqu Barbhuiya on Unsplash In the vast landscape of consumerism, paper receipts hold a crucial place in the routine functioning of business transactions. Utilized across various sectors, such as grocery stores, banking, restaurants, and gas stations, receipts have become an omnipresent component of modern commerce. Receipts, valued for their fast and legible printing, play a crucial role in personal and commercial accounting. Although Canada does not have explicit legislation mandating receipts (for payment acknowledgement), it has become a widely adopted practice, effectively making it a de facto standard.\nWith receipts being produced for every transaction, we have become inundated with a constant stream of paper, contributing to environmental concerns and clutter in our daily lives. Given that Canada processes around 30 million financial transactions daily (Bank of Canada), it is difficult to quantify the number of receipts produced. Highlighting the broader context, the global market for receipt paper was estimated at USD 4.16 billion in 2023 (Grandview Research), demonstrating the vast consumption and environmental footprint of transactions worldwide. Transitioning from the scale of consumption to its environmental implications, the life cycle of receipt paper offers insight into the multifaceted impacts and risks of this ubiquitous product.\nThe purpose of this project is to examine the lifecycle of receipt paper, from resource extraction through to disposal. Concurrently, this project aims to perform an in-depth risk assessment of occupational hazards throughout each phase and analyze the effectiveness of current hazard control measures. The objective of this analysis is to illuminate the environmental and health implications of receipt paper production and use, guiding more sustainable practices and risk mitigation strategies."},"title":"The Paper Trail Begins"},"/life-cycle/":{"data":{"":"","#":" Image Courtesy of Panda Paper on Unsplash The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) critically examines the environmental footprint of thermal receipt paper from production to disposal.
