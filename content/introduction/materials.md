Thermal receipt paper utilizes a thermochromic process for inkless printing, achieved through its multi-layered composition. These layers, comprising the topcoat, thermal layer, base paper, precoat, and backcoat, work in concert to ensure the print's durability and clarity. Central to its function is the thermal layer, where a mix of active agents triggers the color-changing process essential for printing.
