<p style="text-align: center;">ðŸ‘‹ <b>Welcome to my Project Website</b> ðŸ‘‹</p>

My name is Ben Lipovski and I am a student enrolled in spring 2024 SPPH 381E (Work & Health) at the University of British Columbia. This website is the result of my examination into the health and occupational hazards associated with receipt paper. Designed using Hugo, a static site generator written in Go, this website uses the Hextra theme to host an engaging and accessible space to share my findings and insights.

This project website is hosted on my personal portfolio. Visit {{< icon "blogo" >}} [lipovski.ca](https://lipovski.ca) to explore more about my work and academic endeavors.

For further information on the Hugo framework and the Hextra theme, please consult the following links:
