## What is Receipt Paper?

A point-of-sales (POS) receipt is a document acknowledging that a person has received money or property in payment following a sale or other transfer of goods or provision of a service[^1] [^2]. It serves as proof of transaction and typically includes details such as the date of purchase, the items purchased, their prices, the total amount paid, and the seller’s information[^2]. Unlike other receipts, such as invoices which are issued prior to payment as a request for payment, or e-receipts sent digitally to customers[^5], POS receipts are tangible proof provided immediately after a purchase[^1].

In this project, the term **Receipt Paper** will be consistently used to denote the specific type of thermally activated paper utilized for POS-prompted receipts.

Receipt paper is the specialized paper utilized for printing receipts, with thermal paper being the most commonly used type[^6] [^7]. 
This technology is also employed in thermal barcode labels, shipping labels, and other applications requiring quick and durable printing solutions[^6] [^7].

## Comparison to Traditional Paper

Receipt paper is the specialized paper utilized for printing receipts, with thermal paper being the most commonly used type[^6] [^7]. 
Designed to be cost-effective for businesses requiring swift, ink-free printing, receipt paper is available in rolls, making it easily adaptable to the high-volume demands of retail and service industry transactions[^7]. 
However, its chemical coating poses environmental recycling challenges, contrasting with the more straightforward, eco-friendly recycling of regular paper[^5] [^8]—a subject that will be further addressed later in this project.
